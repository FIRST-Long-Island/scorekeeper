Browse the releases page for version you are looking forward, and click on the appropriate link to download the archived software.  The software is stored on the server as an archived .zip or .tar file.  Note that most users (Windows and Mac users especially) will want to download the .zip format archive file.  Once you have downloaded the archive file, uncompress the file using the appropriate tool for your computer.

Note that you want to download the "FIRST-Tech-Challenge-Live" archive file, and not the "Source code" file.  The "Source code" file does not contain any usable content.

## Documentation
Currently, the user documentation exists as a living Google Drive document.  You can access the document using the following link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;[User Documentation for Scorekeeping Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5OHQiNgm70inQ-FRYEhM0RPY0hKwaQIH3_FfDnf1bw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Reporting Issues
Click on the "Issues" link towards the upper left hand corner of the main page of this repository to navigate to the Issue Tracking Database page.  If you are logged in to your GitHub user account (which is available for free from GitHub) you can create and reply to issues in the database.  

The developers of the software requested that if you encounter a bug, you copy and archive (compress into .zip form) the "db" subdirectory and then create an issue on the Issues database and attach the .zip file to the newly created issue and save the attachment with the issue.  The "db" folder is located in the "lib" subfolder.
